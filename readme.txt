Difference Tool
---------------
- Use this tool to compare 2 lists where entries are separated by new lines. Lists can both be out of order.

- The tool takes 2 sets of inputs, iterates through, creating lists of items by new line. It then removes whitespace with map() where function iterates and trims each entry. 

- Each list is then duplicated as a set so each list can be compared with each opposite set. Slightly better efficiency.
